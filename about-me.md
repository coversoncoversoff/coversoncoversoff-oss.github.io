Hi! I'm Athar, a cricket enthusiast and Physics researcher. Welcome to my blog where I combine cricket insights with data-driven analysis.

I am Aadityan Ganesh --- an auction theorist at Princeton University by day and cricket nerd by night. Beyond these, I am also your stop if you want to talk Tamil films and broadly, Indian films.
