Hi! I'm Atharv Tambade, a first-year Ph.D. student in Theoretical Physics at the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia-Tech).  

My primary interest lies in cricket; everything else is just a peer-reviewed distraction.
In the rare moments I’m not watching a Test match, I tend to wander into Theoretical Biophysics, Nonlinear Systems, and Control Theory. 

Beyond research, I enjoy talking about anything interesting — cinema, books (as long as they’re not trying to tell me how to fix my life), or whatever sparks curiosity.
I love connecting with people who get excited about ideas.
